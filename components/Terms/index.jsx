          These terms will automatically apply to you if you download or use the
          app, so you should be sure you properly read them before using the
          app. The program, its components, or any of our trademarks may not be
          copied or modified in any way. The app's source code cannot be
          attempted to be extracted, and creating derivative works or other
          language translations of the app is not permitted. The application
          itself, along with all associated trademarks, copyrights, database
          rights, and other intellectual property rights, remain Mr. Healer's

          Mr. Healer is dedicated to making sure the software is as effective
          and practical as possible. Because of this, we reserve the right to
          alter the app or impose fees for using its features whenever we see
          fit. You will never be charged for the app or its services unless you
          are completely aware of what you are purchasing.

        <p className="text-[#2F2F2F] text-sm font-light leading-6 mb-4">
          To provide our Service, the Mr Healer app keeps and processes personal
          data that you have submitted to us. You are in charge of keeping the
          app and your phone secure. In order to avoid software restrictions and
          limits imposed by your device's official operating system, we advise
          against jailbreaking or rooting your phone. It might weaken your
          phone's security measures, leave your device open to malware, viruses,
          and harmful apps, and it might prevent the Mr. Healer app from
          operating at all or even just partially.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#2F2F2F] text-sm font-light leading-6 mb-4">
          The app does use third-party services whose terms and conditions are
          disclosed.{" "}

          You should be informed that Mr. Healer will not accept responsibility
          for all situations. The app will need to be connected to the internet
          in order to perform some features. If you don't have access to Wi-Fi
          and have used up all of your data allotment, Mr. Healer is not
          responsible for the app not functioning properly. The connection can
          be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network carrier.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#2F2F2F] text-sm font-light leading-6 mb-4">
          The terms of the contract with your mobile network carrier will still
          be in effect if you use the app outside of a Wi-Fi hotspot, so keep
          that in mind. As a result, you can incur additional fees from third
          parties or be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
          the time that you were connected and using the app. By using the app,
          you agree to pay any fees that may apply, including roaming data fees
          if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e., region or
          nation) without turning off data roaming. Please be aware that we
          presume you have permission from the bill payer to use the app if you
          aren't the one paying the bill for the device on which you're using
          it.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#2F2F2F] text-sm font-light leading-6 mb-4">
          In a similar vein, Mr. Healer can't always be held accountable for how
          you use the app, i.e. You must keep your device charged; Mr. Healer
          cannot be held responsible if you are unable to use the Service
          because the battery on your device runs out.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#2F2F2F] text-sm font-light leading-6 mb-4">
          Regarding Mr. Healer's liability for your use of the app, it's
          critical to remember that, despite our efforts to keep it current and
          accurate at all times, we do rely on outside sources to supply
          information to us so that we can make it available to you. If you rely
          only on this app functionality, Mr. Healer disclaims all
          responsibility for any loss—direct or indirect—that you may incur as a
          result.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#2F2F2F] text-sm font-light leading-6 mb-4">
          We might decide to upgrade the app at any point. The app is now
          accessible on Android, but if you want to keep using it, you'll need
          to download updates because the system requirements for that platform
          (and any others we decide to make the app available on) are subject to
          change. Mr. Healer does not guarantee that it will update the software
          frequently enough to make it applicable to you and/or compatible with
          the version of Android you have set up on your device. You agree to
          accept updates to the app whenever they are given to you, but we
          reserve the right to stop delivering the app at any moment without
          prior notification to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
          termination,
